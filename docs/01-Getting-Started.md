# Ape Framework - Getting Started Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ape Framework! This guide will walk you through the initial setup and configuration of your new ASP.NET Core MVC application.

**Live Demo:** https://Illustrate.net
**Repository:** https://github.com/MikishVaughn/Ape

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 10.0 SDK** or later
  - Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
  - Verify installation: `dotnet --version`

- **SQL Server**
  - LocalDB (included with Visual Studio) for development
  - SQL Server Express or full SQL Server for production

- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** (recommended)
  - Visual Studio: Include "ASP.NET and web development" workload
  - VS Code: Install C# extension

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikishVaughn/Ape.git
cd Ape
```

---

## Step 2: Set Up the Master Encryption Key

The framework uses AES-256 encryption for storing sensitive credentials. You must set a master key before running the application.

### For Development (Windows)

**Option A: Environment Variable**

1. Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
2. Add a new User variable:
   - Name: `MASTER_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ILLUSTRATE`
   - Value: A secure string of 32+ characters (e.g., `YourSecure32CharacterKeyHere123!`)

**Option B: User Secrets (Recommended for Development)**

```bash
cd Ape
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "MASTER_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ILLUSTRATE" "YourSecure32CharacterKeyHere123!"
```

### For Production

Set environment variables at the server/hosting level:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MASTER_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ILLUSTRATE` | Encryption key (32+ characters) |
| `DB_SERVER_ILLUSTRATE` | Database server address |
| `DB_NAME_ILLUSTRATE` | Database name |
| `DB_USER_ILLUSTRATE` | Database username |
| `DB_PASSWORD_ILLUSTRATE` | Database password |

---

## Step 3: Configure the Database

### Development (LocalDB)

The default configuration in `appsettings.json` uses LocalDB:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=aspnet-Ape;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

No changes needed for local development.

### Production

The application automatically constructs the connection string from environment variables when they are present. Set the `DB_*` variables listed above.

---

## Step 4: Run Database Migrations

The application auto-migrates on startup, but you can also run migrations manually:

```bash
cd Ape
dotnet ef database update
```

This creates all required tables:
- Identity tables (users, roles, claims)
- UserProfiles (extended user data)
- SystemCredentials (encrypted credential storage)
- EmailLogs (email audit trail)
- PDFCategories & CategoryFiles (document library)
- GalleryCategories & GalleryImages (photo gallery)
- LinkCategories & CategoryLinks (links directory)

---

## Step 5: Build and Run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

The application will start and display the URL (typically `https://localhost:5001`).

---

## Step 6: First Login

### Default Admin Account

On first run, if no admin users exist, the system creates a default administrator:

- **Email:** admin@admin.com
- **Password:** Admin123!

**IMPORTANT:** Change this password immediately after first login!

### Custom Admin Credentials

You can specify custom admin credentials in `appsettings.json` before first run:

```json
{
  "AdminEmail": "your-email@example.com",
  "AdminPassword": "YourSecurePassword123!"
}
```

---

## Step 7: Configure Email (Required for Full Functionality)

Email is required for:
- User registration (email confirmation)
- Password reset
- Contact form
- Two-factor authentication setup

See the **Email Configuration Guide** for detailed setup instructions.

**Quick Setup:**
1. Log in as Admin
2. Navigate to **System Credentials**
3. Add your SMTP credentials (at minimum):
   - `SMTP_SERVER` - e.g., smtp.gmail.com
   - `SMTP_PORT` - e.g., 587
   - `SMTP_USERNAME` - your email
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD` - your password or app password
   - `SMTP_SSL` - true

---

## Step 8: Configure Site Settings for Social Sharing

To ensure your links display properly when shared on social media (Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.), configure these settings:

1. Log in as Admin
2. Navigate to **System Credentials**
3. Add these credentials:

| Key | Category | Value |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `SITE_NAME` | Config | Your site name (e.g., "My Company") |
| `SITE_URL` | Config | Your full site URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) |
| `SITE_DESCRIPTION` | Config | A brief site description (under 160 characters) |

4. Replace the default share image at `/wwwroot/Images/Site/ApeTree.png` with your own branded image (recommended: 1200x630 pixels)

**Note:** The `SITE_URL` is required for proper social media link previews to work correctly.

---

## Step 9: Verify Your Setup

After completing the steps above, verify everything works:

1. **Test Email:** Go to Admin menu → Email Test → Send a test email
2. **Register a User:** Log out, register a new account, confirm email
3. **Document Library:** Create a folder, upload a PDF
4. **Photo Gallery:** Create a category, upload an image
5. **Contact Form:** Submit a test message from the Contact page

## Troubleshooting

### "Master key not configured"

Ensure the `MASTER_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ILLUSTRATE` environment variable is set and restart the application.

### Database connection errors

1. Verify SQL Server is running
2. Check connection string in appsettings.json
3. For production, verify environment variables are set

### Email not sending

1. Check System Credentials for correct email settings
2. Use the Email Test page to diagnose issues
3. Review Email Logs for error messages
