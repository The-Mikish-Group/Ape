# Ape Framework - Administrator Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers all administrative features available to users with the **Admin** or **Manager** role. Both roles have access to system configuration, user management, and content management tools.

**Key Difference:** The Manager role has the same access as Admin, except Managers **cannot access System Credentials**. This allows you to delegate administrative tasks while keeping sensitive configuration secure.

| Menu Item | Purpose | Admin | Manager |

## System Credentials Management

The System Credentials page allows you to securely store and manage sensitive configuration values like API keys, database connections, and email credentials.

### Security Features

- **AES-256 Encryption:** All values encrypted before database storage
- **Audit Trail:** Every access (view, create, edit, delete) is logged
- **Categorization:** Organize credentials by type (Database, API, Email, etc.)
- **Built-in Testing:** Test database connections and API keys directly

### Adding a Credential

1. Navigate to **System Credentials**
2. Click **Add New Credential**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Key:** Unique identifier (e.g., `SMTP_PASSWORD`)
   - **Name:** Friendly name (e.g., "SMTP Password")
   - **Category:** Select appropriate category
   - **Value:** The secret value (will be encrypted)
4. Click **Save**

### Viewing Credentials

- Credentials are displayed with masked values by default
- Click **Show** to reveal the decrypted value (this action is logged)
- Use **Test** buttons where available to verify credentials work

### Audit History

1. Click **Audit History** on any credential
2. View all access events including:
   - Who accessed it
   - What action was taken
   - When it occurred
   - IP address and user agent

### Common System Credentials

The following credentials are used by the framework:

| Key | Category | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `SITE_NAME` | Config | Site name displayed in headers and titles |
| `SITE_URL` | Config | Full site URL (e.g., `https://illustrate.net`) - used for social sharing links |
| `SITE_DESCRIPTION` | Config | Default site description for social media sharing |
| `ACS_CONNECTION` | Email | Azure Communication Services connection string |
| `ACS_SENDER` | Email | Azure sender email address |
| `SMTP_HOST` | Email | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Email | SMTP server port |
| `SMTP_USER` | Email | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Email | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_SENDER` | Email | SMTP sender email address |
| `CONTACT_FORM_RECIPIENTS` | Email | Comma-separated contact form recipient emails |

### Social Media Sharing Setup

To enable proper link previews when your site is shared on social media (Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, etc.), configure these credentials:

1. **SITE_URL** (Required)
   - Set to your full site URL including `https://`
   - Example: `https://illustrate.net`
   - Used to build canonical URLs and image paths for sharing

2. **SITE_DESCRIPTION** (Optional)
   - Default description shown when pages are shared
   - Keep it under 160 characters for best display
   - Example: `A production-ready ASP.NET Core MVC framework`

3. **Default Share Image**
   - The default image used for sharing is `/Images/Site/ApeTree.png`
   - Replace this image with your own branded image (recommended size: 1200x630 pixels)
   - Individual pages can override this via `ViewData["OgImage"]`

**Per-Page Overrides:**

Individual views can customize their sharing metadata by setting these ViewData values:
```csharp
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Page Title";
    ViewData["OgDescription"] = "Custom description for this page";
    ViewData["OgImage"] = "https://example.com/custom-image.jpg";
    ViewData["OgType"] = "article"; // Default is "website"
}
```

## Email System Administration

### Email Test Page

The Email Test page helps you verify your email configuration:

1. Navigate to **Email Test**
2. Enter a recipient email address
3. Click **Test Azure Email** or **Test SMTP Email**
4. Check results for success or error messages

### Email Logs

View all sent emails and their status:

1. Navigate to **Email Logs**
2. Use filters to search by:
   - Date range
   - Recipient
   - Status (success/failed)
   - Email type
3. View details including error messages for failed emails
4. Clear old logs using the cleanup options

### Email Failover System

The framework uses a dual-provider system:
- **Primary:** Azure Communication Services
- **Fallback:** SMTP

If Azure fails 3 consecutive times, the system automatically skips Azure for 2 minutes and uses SMTP directly. This prevents delays when Azure is unavailable.

---

## Contact Form Settings

Configure who receives messages from the public contact form:

1. Navigate to **Contact Form Settings**
2. Enter email addresses separated by commas
3. Click **Save**

Example: `admin@example.com, support@example.com`

### Anti-Spam Protection

The contact form includes three layers of protection:
1. **Honeypot fields:** Hidden fields that bots fill out
2. **JavaScript token:** Required token that bots can't generate
3. **Timing validation:** Form must be open for 3+ seconds

Spam attempts are logged with IP addresses in the email logs.

4. **Limit admin accounts** - Only grant admin access when necessary

### User Management

1. **Require email confirmation** - Enabled by default
2. **Encourage 2FA** - Recommend users enable two-factor authentication
3. **Monitor active users** - Watch for suspicious activity patterns

### Content Security

1. **Use appropriate access levels** - Don't make admin documents public
2. **Review uploaded content** - Check documents and images before publishing
3. **Regular backups** - Back up the database and uploaded files

---

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance

- **Clear old email logs** - Remove logs older than needed
- **Review credential audit logs** - Check for suspicious access
- **Update credentials** - Rotate API keys and passwords
- **Database backup** - Regular backups of the database
- **File backup** - Backup `/ProtectedFiles/` and `/wwwroot/Galleries/`

### Troubleshooting

**Users can't receive emails:**
1. Check Email Test page
2. Review Email Logs for errors

**Files not uploading:**
1. Check folder permissions
2. Verify file types (PDF for documents, images for gallery)
3. Check file size limits
